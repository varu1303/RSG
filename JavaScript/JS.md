# JavaScript
  
#### Introduction
*JavaScript* was initially created to *add interactivity to Web Pages*.  

Initially it was called "LiveScript" but since Java was really popular at that time, it was decided to market it as something close to Java but it isn't the case.   

It is a scripting language which means it acts on an existing entity or system like Web Browsers.  
Let's take a command "Walk", it would require a Person to carry it out. Similarly in case of JavaScript commands, a system like Web Browser is required to carry them out and these systems need an Engine to understand these commands. Different Browsers come with different engines and to keep the language behavior consistent across different browsers these engines implement ECMA standards which tell how the language should behave.

**_Summary_**   
JS code called "scripts" are executed as plain text and don't need a compilation step prior to execution. A special program called [the JavaScript Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine) is responsible for converting script into machine code and executing it.  
Examples of different JS Engines: V8 (Google Chrome), SpiderMonkey (Mozilla Firefox).
